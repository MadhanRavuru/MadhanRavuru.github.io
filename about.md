Welcome to my blog **PointRCNN: 3D Object Proposal Generation and Detection from Point Cloud**. This blog proposes PointRCNN for 3D object detection directly from raw point cloud. The whole framework is composed of two stages: stage-1 for the bottom-up 3D proposal generation and stage-2 for refining proposals in the canonical coordinates to obtain the final detection results.
